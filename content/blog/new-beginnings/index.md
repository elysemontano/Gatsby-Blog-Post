About twelve years ago, I began writing music and quickly decided to produce the music I wrote.  I learned via YouTube on how to produce music using FL Studio and after a few years of tinkering, I decided to go to school full time.  There I learned many different DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), and spent years honing those skills and learning the ins and outs of audio.  

After school, I entered into live sound engineering where I would run sound for live events, set up and break down the sound equipment if stationary setup was not available.  There I discovered my love and passion for troubleshooting and problem solving.  As you can imagine, many things can go wrong when doing a live event, and you must be quick on your feet and be able to get to the root of the problem quickly.  

Last year, I decided to dive deeper into the problem solving and troubleshooting, and began my adventure into software development.  Not only do I get to create new things....such as this blog post, but I get to use those critical thinking skills to get to the root of problems and think creatively on how to fix them.  

Next week, I begin my journey as an intern for a software development company and I am super excited to expand my knowledge further and be a part of this incredible community!
